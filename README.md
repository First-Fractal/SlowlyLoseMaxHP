# Slowly Lose Max HP
Slowly Lose Max HP is a mod that will slowly drain your max HP. You can configure how much Max HP it will drain, and the rate it will drain.
When there is a boss alive, the mod will drain your max HP faster. You can turn that off, or customize how much it will drain.
The Nurse will have a shop that will sell life crystals after defeating the evil boss, and life fruits after defeating Plantera.
She will sell life crystals for 10 gold, and life fruits for 2.5 gold. The shop can be disabled, or configure the amount she sell the life items for.
